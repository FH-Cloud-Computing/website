Everybody needs help, and since this is a new situation we have prepared a few channels where you
can get help.

## Before you ask for help

- Make sure you strip the code you have a problem with of all unnecessary code, comments, etc.
- Make sure you upload your code to GitHub so others can take a look at it.
- Make sure you think through and describe your problem in more detail as you would in a 
  conversation, as digitally it may be harder to follow.

## Where to ask for help

- The primary avenue of getting help is on the [Slack channel for this course](https://moodle.fh-campuswien.ac.at/mod/url/view.php?id=319750).
- Join the bi-weekly online consultation sessions.
- If you need to send us something, please do so on the [email addresses on the introduction page](../index.md).
